# STM32F4-uart-driver-from-scratch

In this project, I have developed a UART driver library for the STM32F4 series microcontrollers. The driver supports data communication through  methods, including interrupt, polling, and Direct Memory Access (DMA). This allows for flexible and efficient data transfer depending on the application requirements.
